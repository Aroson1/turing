---
This is my submission for the WinterHacks hackathon. Ask Atlas is a web application built using React and the Google Gemini Pro AI model.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add the API_KEY in a local .env file and add it to the root directory
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Tech Stack Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- [Google Gemini Pro AI](https://www.google.com/gemini/) - A powerful AI model used for various natural language processing tasks.
